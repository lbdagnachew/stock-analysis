# stock-analysis

Overview of Project: 

In this project, I’ll perform a data analysis on Green Energy Stocks data to help Steve’s parents make better investment choices. Steve’s parents are interested in investing in DAQO stocks, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. By analyzing a yearly return and total daily volume from the year 2017 and 2018, Steve will help them determine if DQ stocks are worth investing their parents’ money. I’ll be using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as a tool. 

Results: 

Based on my analysis below, Green-energy stocks had a positive yearly return in 2017 - only one green-energy stock (TERP)) had a negative yearly return. However, in 2018, the majority of stocks had negative returns. The DQ stock had almost 200% yearly return in 2017, but in 2018 the stock dropped and finished the year with -63%. I would recommend for Steve Parents to re-think their decision on investing on DQ Stocks as the results show a negative outlook. 


How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*

writing the Green Stocks analysis was long and complicated as it was my first-time using VBA. By the time I got to the refactoring code, it seems much manageable. Therefore, for me the advantage of refactoring code is, it becomes easier to understand the logic of our code and code takes less time to complete.
